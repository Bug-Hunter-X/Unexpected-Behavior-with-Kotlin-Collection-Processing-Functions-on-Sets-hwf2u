This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using Kotlin's collection processing functions (map, filter, reduce) with Sets.  Sets, unlike Lists, do not guarantee a specific order of elements. This example shows how relying on a specific order after a map operation on a set can lead to unexpected results and hard-to-debug errors. The solution shows a correct approach to handle cases where element order matters.
